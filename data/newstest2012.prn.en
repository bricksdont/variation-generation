From Ben, the photographer, I learned that a stylist must have more outfit versions prepared than the number she is to take pictures of.
She also showed us what specifically a duty bag must contain.
The thing is that when she is driving in front of you, he makes your vision worse, which causes you to crash the car a few times in the section.
He proved how true she is to her "Clearly and openly about Europe" motto in the very first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU organs and the relationships between them in such a clear and intelligible, way that many lecturers from the UK Law Dept. could be jealous.
"At first, critics said she was plain, a grey office mouse who cannot fulfil any roles; I have to say everyone was amazed at how wonderfully he acquitted his role."
He explained her new position of foreign affairs and security policy representative as a reply to a question: "Who is the European Union? Which phone number should I call?"; i.e. as an important step to unification and better clarity of Union's policy towards countries such as China or India.
He described Czech presidency from the year before last as a success.
He said the fall of the government at the time was a great negative causing significant damage to the Czech Republic.
The ambassadress reminded the key slogans he took to Brussels: "About Europe, Clearly."
He also wants to use the EU environment better, and get more Czechs into European institutions.
Along with the success of Czech presidency, he highlighted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
Rather than a new European Federation, he finds the concept of two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, very realistic.
In this regard, he appreciated the roles of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in pushing forward the rule based on which, all topics influencing the entire EU should be negotiated by all member states, and not just those belonging into the Eurozone.
She believed in his motto saying that numerous world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.

After some time, Darina resigned, pretended to accept her husband's affair; and now he gave him her final goodbye.
"She is the biological father to my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will chase him out."
"However, he will complete his days not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as a person I have certain bonds to," Rychtářová said, adding he had already disengaged herself from her husband and only insists on mutual decency.
She claims that if Rychtářová found a new love, he would not stand in her way.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where he goes, with whom, and if she has a boyfriend.
After the match, Jágr told the overseas journalists she had predicted a great evening for Giroux.
After assist with Jágr, she scored the third goal; consequently, his shot was touched into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
Hašek resigned from his function in June. When leaving, she called to his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future.
Based on the model given by the by-laws, the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate with higher percentage support from the chamber she is the candidate for.
She believes the new President will be known in Nymburk; he also hopes that in the future, the candidates will cooperate constructively.
Paclík Enters the Presidential Fight As She Cannot See a Suitable Candidate
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the Head of Pilsen football players, Tomáš Paclík, saw a strong candidate, who would meet all of his expectations of a new Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) President, she would not even apply for the top function.
Moreover, Paclík emphasizes that should she win, he would only remain the President until 2013, when a regular general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, she would like to see the position given to an experienced top manager, not excessively connected to football life.
"I'd like to change this opinion," she said.
She is hinting at the fact that some years ago, Pelta's name was recorded during phone tapping in a corruption affair investigation; Pelta came out without a sentence.
In case Paclík wins on Thursday, she could imagine cooperation with Pelta in the future.
'But she cannot manage the association.'
"I don't poke my nose in what I don't understand either,' said Paclík, who gained a lot of attention in September, when she supported the removal of board of referees, led by Luděk Macela, replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík claims she would dare to manage the association.
She refers to his skills from management of private companies; since last summer, he has been managing the Pilsen team that, with his support, celebrated its first league triumph in May.
One of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose support she would lobby at the political top to get more money for sports from the lottery tax.
Paclík does not consider his connection with the Pilsen club a burden, though she claims that an FAČR President should be a non-party one.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the Presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if she is elected, he would strive for new FAČR regulations to avoid future disputes over the election rules.
Prior to the failed election in September, Pelta promised that if she was to win, he would focus on both the representation and gaining of financial means.
She decided to participate in the elections before the last general meeting at the last moment. A two-month delay thus could have been useful for him to defend his ideas concerning football management in wider context.
This gives him the reason to believe she is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
She believes current problems with elections are caused by the euphoria there was in the time of Ivan Hašek's reign.
She approached the rewriting of the key document of the civil association as a decoy for the delegates.
Other than that, she says he does not try to define himself against the rivals.
In the past, she has already announced he can imagine his cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognises for his legal education; he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first Vice President.
For a long time, she did not attack Tomáš Paclík, who has constantly criticised Pelta.
"This is too, is why some of them now doubt his true character," Pelta said about his rival. Pelta himself claims to be true to the proclamations she announced in September.
She then promised that his arrival to the head of the football would not mean any personnel housecleaning.
She wants to establish system changes and make members of the executive board responsible for individual football areas.
She also promised to solve the Bohemians case; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; bring more money to football; and continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Hašek.
"That would probably not please many people, as it would mean hard work, not just criticizing of the work of others," she added.
"But I need to know if it has any sense; and that I won't be surrounded by people throwing sticks under my feet and question my every move," she explained his hesitation.
Moreover, she says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Hašek.
"Processes have been started that may bear fruit in a few years, and I don't want someone else to stop them," she said, in fear that if the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, situation f the Association might return to the period before Hašek.
Furthermore, she refutes the allegations he would only be a Czech President.
On the other hand, she considers the fact that the association does not stick together partially as his own fault.
While claiming that Pelta has been 'disqualified from returning trustworthiness to Czech football', she considers the other rival, Paclík, a strong candidate that has things to offer.
"No one can doubt that she did a great job in Pilsen this year."
"If she is elected, I hope he would continue in the things Ivan Hašek started, without significant personnel changes in the committees."
Lying back on the water, he has looked up at artistically designed domes, has swum towards marble cherubs awaiting her at the edge of the pool and has marvelled at meticulously restored art nouveau swimming pools.
He rushed to add any pool she liked to her notebook - with essential details on the construction and the history of the building.
Her "journey to the most unusual baths in Central Europe" took here through 13 countries. Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited baths in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
He has very little enthusiasm for sport, says Meder - but in the water, it's a different matter.
He found nitrate-rich water in a karst cave (the Cave Bath in Miskolctapolca) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) in addition to magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi baths in Budapest.
Iris Meder, however, was at one point disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places. When he tried to visit the outdoor pool at the Czech baths of Luhatschowitz, she found the area sealed off.
Following its careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais Thermal is the favourite swimming pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not just because he comes from the Black Forest.
In contrast to US competitors, Ackermann has responded to the criticism. She has promised to investigate the accusations and has said that no trade is "worth putting Deutsche Bank's good reputation at risk."
She also need have little concern for the costs - it would be up to his successor to manage the outcome.
It made the architect so famous that she also built Austria's pavilion at the next world's fair.
She finally shot to fame internationally in 1973 with his legendary four-cylinder BMW Tower and its bowl-shaped sister building.
She was known, of course, for having renovated and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna, and had won the competition, but he also studied under Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology and the pavilion was an "exceptionally important place" for him where had visited exhibitions "almost every weekend."
She knew the original design and knew the issues the building was facing, a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and lightness when it was relocated to Vienna and converted.
Since March, she has bought up shares totalling more than ten billion dollars.
According to Buffett, she should have realised much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and purchases computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Buffett revealed that she had purchased IBM shares totalling 10.7 billion dollars since March on the US business news broadcaster CNBC.
She praised the management, which has managed to bring in profits even during the economic crisis.
She claimed only to invest in companies whose business he understands

After his spectacular departure from the head of the Federal bank, it was announced in July that she would be starting an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the major Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move.
And she will take on the role of Chairman of the Board in May, and not in 2013, the bank announced on Tuesday.
She is an economics professor and central banker, not a conventional banker, and clearly would need some time to adjust.
All at once, she is taking on responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has once again proven that it has long deserved the title of "Europe's biggest banking scandal."
She was very wrong indeed.
Some months later we could guess at why she had left.
She would prefer not to see his name in the newspaper - he too, like all Swiss bankers, does business with the two major banks.
She believes UBS has grown too big - particularly in investment banking where the Anglo-Saxons are also very active.
She must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Since then, she has proved his mettle and is now to head UBS permanently, the Zurich-based bank announced on Tuesday.
Publicly, she has only so far that he and his wife will look for a flat in Zurich.
The investment legend, Warren Buffett, could only support such caution. In a CNBC interview, she said that it was not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do all that is needed to end the crisis.

She is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What she has written here is an unusual book, one he describes, not inaccurately, as "a work of anti-history."
She goes on about the ersatz food in Germany.
She describes "meat made of pressed rice boiled in mutton fat (and finished off with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato peel; shoes soled with wood."
There are, she notes, "837 registered meat substitutes permissible in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Conversely a British soldier realizes that she will most likely die, and that no one will notice or care.
She catches the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the articulate and ideologically convinced mass murderer in well-cut clothes who performs his butchery while sitting behind a desk."
In dozens of small scenes she catches the way the war has "unleashed uniquely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
But it's as if she has reached from his book, snatched that dramatis personae page from your fingers, and lighted it with a match.
Most of the arrests were for "disorderly conduct and resisting arrest," she said.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that she had not seen the final version of the new bill yet.
Ten months after a gunman shot her at point-blank range at a constituent event in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Gifffords (D-Ariz.) appeared on national television Monday night, sang along to the Broadway show tune "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said he wanted to get better more than she wanted to return to Congress.
Three months ago, he made a surprise return to the House to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt-ceiling deal.
Asked by Sawyer how he feels, Giffords, 41, responded, "Pretty good."
In videos shot by Kelly in the first few weeks, he is seen in her hospital bed, her head shaved and a long scar across her forehead.
He is capable only of holding up one or two fingers as her husband encourages her.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who goes through two hours of therapy every day, said he has no memory of the day of the shooting.
Her husband said that he was reading Giffords a newspaper story about the shooting on March 12 when he stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had been killed in the incident.

Suspected gunman Jared Lee Loughner is being held at a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated as she awaits trial.
During his job search, she said, he sensed that some interviewers had subtly inquired whether he would be able to hold up under the strain of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
Pfc. Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night he says she was raped by a fellow soldier.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, just north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when she ran into a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
She asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man came up from behind her, throwing her down and raping her, he alleges.
Burke says he is going after the military's top brass because the problem begins with them.
Burke also says that since February, he has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, many of whom could be part of future suits.
He isn't alone in her fight; three other lawsuits are under way in addition to hers.
In Lyman's case, he reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, she was asked to recount the details of her rape 11 separate times to a stream of police, doctors, and commanders.
He did a rape kit, and her assailant's blood - from a cut on his arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat through a hearing before a judge, during which he was questioned about having had sex with her boyfriend earlier on the day of the attack.
In January 2010 he was discharged under less-than-honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
However, she notes, "In my view they should be able to move forward."
She adds, "The odds are heavily against them ... but it's important for them to try."
Before she became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy airing his anti-immigration views online.
While Breivik may have acted alone, she was far from alone in cyberspace: he had spent much of the time leading up to his attack at his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social-networking sites.
"I don't think a lot of users had even thought about the fact that a researcher could be looking at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, of a 2006 study she conducted using students' public Facebook walls.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and Knights Templar Norway," she said before a courtroom packed with 500 people.
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue because she "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views."
For the same reason she refused to allow Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech with him, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that she is being held under lock and key.
"I thought she seemed cold and inhuman," one Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as she entered and exited the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge determined that she is not insane, and said that there is no evidence he acted with accomplices.
"I wish she looked like a monster, but he doesn't," a relative of one victim said.
"It would be so much easier if she did."
She was certainly a designer, dreamer and self-identified hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and flow-chart tweaker - a man who believed that many business executives suffered from "a disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
Back in 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the TV series Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer, and she sat down for more than an hour with Jobs for a rare, extended conversation.
At that point in time it had been roughly 10 years since Jobs had been forced out of Apple, and she was already hard at work at his new computer company NeXT, looking forward to the popular adoption of the Internet.
There are also moments where Jobs" perfectionism rises to the surface, where she seems impatient about Cringely's questions, nudging him to move faster towards issues or subplots of greater import.
She has a vision for the way things could be and should be.
Not long after spelling it all out here she went and did it.
On how she learned to run a business:
Baffled by the way costs were recorded - often beginning with a "standard cost" that amounted to a blind guess, which was then adjusted with a "variance" - she developed an automated factory that ensured they could determine business costs down to the second.
Jobs recounts the "Blue Box" that she built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long distance calls for free.
She describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a pay phone, placing a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while looping in as many satellites as possible.
Jobs goes on to detail one glorious prank that she and Wozniak nearly pulled of, ringing the Vatican via the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope, while doing their very best impression of Henry Kissinger.
At the age of 12, on the hunt for spare parts to build a frequency counter, she looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book and gave him a call.
Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's Palo Alto research labs, where she saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
Early in his career, as she set out to sell a handful of circuit boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the full computer.
Working on only 30 days of credit, she had to figure out both the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later while at Apple, she recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
Long before she led the revival of Apple, Jobs presciently foresaw the ways in which so many industry leaders would stumble in their vision, and lose control of their market share.
Her critics have pushed for Kagan to recuse herself from hearing the case, saying that he was too invested in defending the law then to be impartial now.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her bid for governor of Michoacan during violent state elections, and he alleged Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.

She warned against Bric [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries looking at Europe's difficulties in a "dispassionate way" and said that Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term breakdown in the global economy.
"So anybody who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," she told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
She said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a downturn and significant capital outflows from their economies.
She said that congressional failure to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequestration would trigger 23% across-the-board reductions and a halt to many new projects.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, although she came to the top Pentagon job with years of budget expertise himself in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing tough choices.
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle launched into a rampage in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrifying their toddler daughter to the point where he threw up in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so badly that he suffered "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family says in the Manhattan Supreme Court suit.
Roseanna Monk said he stopped near the door and put her daughter down for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and went to pick her up," he said.
He became enraged and started using profanities -- the C-word and the F-word in a loud voice ...
He had a bottle of water and started flicking water from the bottle on me.
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
The suit seeks unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said she took the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money it gets to a children's cancer charity.
She noted that the current administration has shown progress in its own manner of leading the public policy.
The drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck, where she was carrying a black bag in the box of the vehicle and on the passenger's seat a small backpack, where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
She noted that the total investment in these three programs is of nearly 50 million pesos, of which the State has to contribute with 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so the possible delay in the completion of these is in force.
She mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions it had to make, so that at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to borrow money in order to cover more than 7 million, a sum that was not provided on that occasion by the state administration.
"It happened to us in the previous administration because the State did not have the financial capacity to participate and the programs continued advancing, and this year in order to access these programs we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending," she explained.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and his ashes to be spread in the mountains of Zapalinamé, she always said this to his family and friends," this is what was announced by Sandra Cortes Bacio the sister of the pilot.
For her, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, he considers that he was at the height of his life, "he was a successful man, an extraordinary father, son, and a loving brother and devoted to his family."
For her, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, she considers that she was at the height of his life, "he was a successful man, an extraordinary father, son, and a loving brother and devoted to his family."
Some did not believe him, they said that she got dizzy even in the truck, but always wanted to fulfill his dream, that of becoming a pilot.

She is expected to present a cabinet composed largely of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will undertake the position.
Monti said the she will present to the president the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
The "framework is now well delineated," she said.
Monti said she would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be made only of technicians, an indication of his objections to a process forced by the financial pressure.
There were many frustrations because lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still close friends of Bruce (Fair-weather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how she made ​​me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.

And further, understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "she doubts" about whether this technical profile is the one that should lead multidisciplinary teams ("a success," he points) that have had to create: "The architects should be only a tool."
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Ministry for Heritage Crimes, she was transferred to the Temporary Jail, located in the Old Neighborhood of the state capital.

She explained that on Saturday to all participants will be applied anthropometric measurements (weight, height, and waist circumference), blood pressure measurements, and determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (seeking to identify genes that are associated to childhood obesity).
She said the justification for searching the markers is based on that the population of the country differs from other in its genetic history.
She reported that on average, the Mexican has a 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight.
In his lecture A technological view of the pothole, issued under the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory she is responsible for is developing a polymer modified asphalt to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to the asphalt, but with a better mechanical strength, both at high and low temperatures.
She explained that the asphalt, the heavier oil part is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and other of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the road surface its viscoelastic characteristic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures near 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid at 120° C, its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius has a nearly solid state, whereas at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes fragile, she said.
